Supplementary files for chapter 3 of the thesis [Spinning conformal blocks and applications](http://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/9a1855cf-7522-4ba3-8b1c-10e2a2c6358c). This allows the computation of seed spinning conformal partial waves for the exchange of an operator with SO(d) symmetry (l_1,l_2,l_3) for l_1 >= l_2 >= l_3 >= 0.
